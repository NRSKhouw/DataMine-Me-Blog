I hope this blog can serve as an educational site
for people who are just starting to learn about data science, especially those
who do not come from computer science background. I always feel overwhelmed by
some of the technicalities especially about web-publishing and version control.

In this first entry, I will through the way I setup this blog. I wish to
acknowledge Chris Moffitt with his [Practical Business Python](http://pbpython.com/) blog,
Animesh Bhadra with his [step by step tutorials on Pelican](http://archerimagine.com/)
and hernantz explaining the [submodule method](http://hernantz.github.io/) for
their inspirations and well written guides on the subject.
